== Description ==
The Zen Page Builder Tool quickly allows you to create beautiful pages built from sections containing images, text, and more!

"Zen Pages" are made of sections. You have the option to either use a image or color as a background for each section, and enter a heading and text which fully support links, bold and italics, text alignment, lists, and more.

If you navigate to "Appearance" -> "Customize" -> "Zen Page Builder: Color Scheme", you can select the colors you want to appear in the tool as options for backgrounds, text, ect. White and black will always be available, but it is recommended to use your theme's colors here so everything looks nice and matches. You are free to choose any colors you want though!

The following is also displayed on the admin side when creating or editing a Zen Page, but we've included it here as well.

Instructions:
1. Start by selecting a template below. A form will appear allowing you to enter your text, choose your colors, text alignment, and more.

2. Once you fill out the form, hit the blue "Add To Preview" button, and a preview will let you see what your section will look like when you choose to save.

3. Once you have created a section, you can delete or edit that section by hitting the "X" or "Edit" buttons in the preview. You can also add more sections, or use drag and drop to re-arrange sections.

4. After you have created something you are happy with, be sure to hit "Publish" or "Update" to save your work. 

Notes:
To help you use this tool, each section you create will have a unique ID, visable in the top left of the preview, above the delete and edit buttons.

In the form, on the top in bold, you can see what you are "Currently Editing". This will show "New Section" if the section will be added to the bottom, or it will show the ID of the section you are editing. This way, if for some reason it becomes unclear which section you are editing, you can always refer to this area.

== Installation ==
Install this plugin just as you would any other plugin. Either download from "Plugins" -> "Add New", which handles installation, or download from wordpress.org, and unzip the folder and insert the unzipped folder into /wp-content/plugins.
